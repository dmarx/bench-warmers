Eliminate ambiguity as much as possible as early as possible. 

1. Start with requirements and completion criteria. 
2. Turn that into a PR/FAQ. 
3. Systems diagrams (mermaid) to accompany narrative explanations.
3. README for ergonomics. 
4. Check in on anything that was hallucinated you might want to address upstream. 
5. Generate tests to formalize the desired behaviors and completion criteria. 
6. Double check that tests cover desired behaviors and aren't overly complicated/mocked
6. Generate non test code.
