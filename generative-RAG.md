# generative RAG

label: experimental

just generate faked attempts at the documents you wish the model had in its memory. fill the context with a 

"list documents that would be relevant reference information or background material, and then generate them" prompt. Then just re-ask the question with the context pre-filled.

Bing bang boom.
