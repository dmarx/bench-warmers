# modularized representative government, cellular automata redistricting

labels: experimental, public_good, election_reform

voters alternate voting for representatives, and then once representatives are in place the districts would later have an opportunity 
to vote on which ofthe available options of elected representatives they want to attach their voice to. the purpose of this second step
is to provide a natural mechanism for re-orienting district boundaries if voters so choose. the fraction of representation would also impact
the representatives influence, so e.g. if all of the districts for a representative dissociate from them, that representatives seat becomes powerless.

the issue now is how to protect minority districts from being overwhelmed by coordinated efforts to swarm their jurisdiction.

I think one of the mitigating factors here is the alternating voting periods. If a bunch of districts tried to invade representation for a seat, the consequence of that
invasion is that they would at least temporarily increase the power of that seat. So whoever the minority district voted into power, if surrounding districts tried to "take over" that seat,
they'd have to give that seat increased influence first.

definitely feels like part of this should be that rather than "drawing maps", the regions at play should be responsible for determining their own alignment/allegiance/assignment.

so if the maps are drawing themselves, that means we need some sort of minimal map unit, which could just be property boundaries or some minimal distance or number of "hops".

maybe the vote could just be "do you think your district and your neighbor district should be considered part of the same district?" and if both districts agree to a merge, they get treated
as a unit and can petition a vote to split at some reasonable interval (the interval being some sort of delay between voting events for splitting,
so e.g. a split could happen basically any time, but if the vote fails there is some delay until the next opportunity to split, like a refractory period).

i guess what I'm really after here is a voting map that organizes itself as a kind of cellular automata
